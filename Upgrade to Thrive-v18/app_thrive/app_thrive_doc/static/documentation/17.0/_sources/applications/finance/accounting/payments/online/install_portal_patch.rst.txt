Install the patch to disable online invoice payment
===================================================

Following recent changes in Thrive Bureau ERP 16, you might be warned that disabling the :guilabel:`Invoice
Online Payment` setting will uninstall modules. If you want to disable the feature without
uninstalling modules, follow the steps below to install the module **Payment - Account / Invoice
Online Payment Patch**.

.. note::
   | If your Thrive Bureau ERP database is created after the module **Payment - Account / Invoice Online Payment
     Patch** was released, you don't have anything to do.
   | To check if the module is already installed, go to :guilabel:`Apps`, remove the `Apps` filter,
     and search for `account_payment`. If the module **Payment - Account / Invoice Online Payment
     Patch** is present and marked as installed, your Thrive Bureau ERP database is already up-to-date and you
     are able to disable the feature without side-effect.

Update Thrive Bureau ERP to the latest release
=================================

The possibility to disable the :guilabel:`Invoice Online Payment` setting without side-effect is
made available through a new Thrive Bureau ERP module; to be able to install it, you must make sure that your
Thrive Bureau ERP source code is up-to-date.

If you use Thrive Bureau ERP on Thrive Bureau ERP.com or Thrive Bureau ERP.sh platform, your code is already up-to-date and you can proceed
to the next step.

If you use Thrive Bureau ERP with an on-premise setup or through a partner, you must update your installation as
detailed in :doc:`this documentation page </administration/maintain/update>`, or by contacting your
integrating partner.

Update the list of available modules
====================================

New modules must be *discovered* by your Thrive Bureau ERP instance to be available in the **Apps** menu.

To do so, activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, and go to :menuselection:`Apps -->
Update Apps List`. A wizard will ask for confirmation.

Install the module Invoice Online Payment Patch
===============================================

.. warning::
   You should never install new modules in your production database without first testing them in a
   duplicate or staging environment. For Thrive Bureau ERP.com customers, a duplicate database can be created
   from the database management page. For Thrive Bureau ERP.sh users, you should use a staging or duplicate
   database. For on-premise users, you should use a staging environment---contact your integrating
   partner for more information regarding how to test a new module in your particular setup.

The module should now be available in your :guilabel:`Apps` menu. Remove the ``Apps`` filter and
search for ``account_payment``; the module :guilabel:`Payment - Account / Invoice Online Payment Patch`
should be available for installation. If you cannot find the module after having updated the list
of available modules, it means your Thrive Bureau ERP source code is not up-to-date; refer to step one of this
page.

Once the module is installed, disabling the feature will work as intended and will not ask you to
uninstall installed applications or modules.
