Installing Thrive Bureau ERP
===============

There are multiple ways to install Thrive Bureau ERP, or not install it at all, depending
on the intended use case.

This documents attempts to describe most of the installation options.

:ref:`setup/install/online`
    The easiest way to use Thrive Bureau ERP in production or to try it.

:ref:`setup/install/packaged`
    Suitable for testing Thrive Bureau ERP, developing modules and can be used for
    long-term production use with additional deployment and maintenance work.

:ref:`setup/install/source`
    Provides greater flexibility:  e.g. allow multiple running Thrive Bureau ERP versions on
    the same system. Good for developing modules, can be used as base for
    production deployment.

:ref:`setup/install/docker`
    If you usually use docker_ for development or deployment, an official
    docker_ base image is available.


.. _setup/install/editions:

Editions
========

There are two different Editions_ of Thrive Bureau ERP: the Community and Enterprise versions.
Using the Enterprise version is possible on `Thrive Bureau ERP Online`_ and accessing the code is
restricted to Enterprise customers and partners. The Community version is freely
available to anyone.

If you already use the Community version and wish to upgrade to Enterprise, please
refer to :ref:`setup/enterprise` (except for :ref:`setup/install/source`).


.. _setup/install/online:

Online
======

Demo
----

To simply get a quick idea of Thrive Bureau ERP, demo_ instances are available. They are
shared instances which only live for a few hours, and can be used to browse
around and try things out with no commitment.

Demo_ instances require no local installation, just a web browser.

Thrive Bureau ERP Online
-----------

Trivial to start with, fully managed and migrated by Thrive Bureau ERP S.A., `Thrive Bureau ERP Online`_
provides private instances and starts out free. It can be used to discover and
test Thrive Bureau ERP and do non-code customizations (i.e. incompatible with custom modules
or the Thrive Bureau ERP Apps Store) without having to install it locally.

Can be used for both testing Thrive Bureau ERP and long-term production use.

Like demo_ instances, `Thrive Bureau ERP Online`_ instances require no local installation, a web
browser is sufficient.


.. _setup/install/packaged:

Packaged installers
===================

Thrive Bureau ERP provides packaged installers for Windows, deb-based distributions
(Debian, Ubuntu, …) and RPM-based distributions (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, …) for
both the Community and Enterprise versions.

These packages automatically set up all dependencies (for the Community version),
but may be difficult to keep up-to-date.

Official Community packages with all relevant dependency requirements are
available on our nightly_ server. Both Community and Enterprise packages can
be downloaded from our download_ page (you must to be logged in as a paying
customer or partner to download the Enterprise packages).

Windows
-------

#. Download the installer from our nightly_ server (Community only) or the Windows installer from
   the download_ page (any edition).
#. Execute the downloaded file.

   .. warning::
      | On Windows 8 and later you may see a warning titled "Windows protected your PC".
      | Click on **More Info** and then on **Run anyway**.

#. Accept the UAC_ prompt.
#. Go through the various installation steps.

Thrive Bureau ERP will automatically be started at the end of the installation.

Linux

~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Debian/Ubuntu

      Thrive Bureau ERP needs a `PostgreSQL`_ server to run properly. The default configuration for
      the Thrive Bureau ERP 'deb' package is to use the PostgreSQL server on the same host as your
      Thrive Bureau ERP instance. Execute the following command in order to install the PostgreSQL server:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo apt install postgresql -y

   .. group-tab:: Fedora

      Thrive Bureau ERP needs a `PostgreSQL`_ server to run properly. Make sure that the `sudo` command is
      available and well configured and, only then, execute the following command in order to
      install the PostgreSQL server:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo dnf install -y postgresql-server
         $ sudo postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql
         $ sudo systemctl enable postgresql
         $ sudo systemctl start postgresql

.. warning::
   `wkhtmltopdf` is not installed through **pip** and must be installed manually in version `0.12.5
   <the wkhtmltopdf download page_>`_ for it to support headers and footers. See our `wiki
   <https://github.com/thrivebureau/thrivebureau/wiki/Wkhtmltopdf>`_ for more details on the various versions.

Repository
~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Debian/Ubuntu

      Thrive Bureau ERP S.A. provides a repository that can be used with Debian and Ubuntu distributions. It can
      be used to install *Thrive Bureau ERP Community Edition* by executing the following commands:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ wget -q -O - https://nightly.thrivebureau.com/thrivebureau.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/thrivebureau-archive-keyring.gpg
          $ echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/thrivebureau-archive-keyring.gpg] https://nightly.thrivebureau.com/{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}/nightly/deb/ ./' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/thrivebureau.list
          $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install thrivebureau

      You can then use the usual `apt-get upgrade` command to keep your installation up-to-date.

   .. group-tab:: Fedora

      Thrive Bureau ERP S.A. provides a repository that can be used with the Fedora distributions. It can be used
      to install *Thrive Bureau ERP Community Edition* by executing the following commands:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://nightly.thrivebureau.com/{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}/nightly/rpm/thrivebureau.repo
         $ sudo dnf install -y thrivebureau
         $ sudo systemctl enable thrivebureau
         $ sudo systemctl start thrivebureau

.. note::
   At this moment, there is no nightly repository for the Enterprise Edition.

Distribution package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Debian/Ubuntu

      Instead of using the repository as described above, the 'deb' packages for both the
      *Community* and *Enterprise* editions can be downloaded from the `official download page
      <download_>`_.

      .. note::
         Thrive Bureau ERP {CURRENT_MAJOR_VERSION} 'deb' package currently supports `Debian 11 (Bullseye)`_,
         `Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)`_ or above.

      Next, execute the following commands **as root**:

      .. code-block:: console

         # dpkg -i <path_to_installation_package> # this probably fails with missing dependencies
         # apt-get install -f # should install the missing dependencies
         # dpkg -i <path_to_installation_package>

      This will install Thrive Bureau ERP as a service, create the necessary PostgreSQL_ user
      and automatically start the server.

      .. warning::
         - The `python3-xlwt` Debian package does not exists in Debian Buster nor Ubuntu 18.04. This
           python module is needed to export into xls format.

           If you need the feature, you can install it manually with:

           .. code-block:: console

              $ sudo pip3 install xlwt

         - The `num2words` python package does not exists in Debian Buster nor Ubuntu 18.04. Textual
           amounts will not be rendered by Thrive Bureau ERP and this could cause problems with the `l10n_mx_edi`
           module.

           If you need this feature, you can install manually with:

           .. code-block:: console

              $ sudo pip3 install num2words

   .. group-tab:: Fedora

      Instead of using the repository as described above, the 'rpm' packages for both the
      *Community* and *Enterprise* editions can be downloaded from the `official download page
      <download_>`_.

      .. note::
         Thrive Bureau ERP {CURRENT_MAJOR_VERSION} 'rpm' package supports Fedora 36.

      Once downloaded, the package can be installed using the 'dnf' package manager:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo dnf localinstall thrive_{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}.latest.noarch.rpm
         $ sudo systemctl enable thrivebureau
         $ sudo systemctl start thrivebureau

.. _setup/install/source:

Source install
==============

The source "installation" is really about not installing Thrive Bureau ERP, and running it directly from source
instead.

It can be more convenient for module developers as the Thrive Bureau ERP source is more easily accessible than
using packaged installation.

It also makes starting and stopping Thrive Bureau ERP more flexible and explicit than the services set up by the
packaged installations, and allows overriding settings using
:ref:`command-line parameters <reference/cmdline>` without needing to edit a configuration file.

Finally it provides greater control over the system's set up, and allows to more easily keep
(and run) multiple versions of Thrive Bureau ERP side-by-side.

Fetch the sources
-----------------

There are two ways to obtain the source code of Thrive Bureau ERP: as a zip **archive** or through **git**.

PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      Thrive Bureau ERP uses PostgreSQL as database management system. `Download and install PostgreSQL
      <https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/>`_ (supported version: 12.0 and later).

      By default, the only user is `postgres` but Thrive Bureau ERP forbids connecting as `postgres`, so you need
      to create a new PostgreSQL user:

      #. Add PostgreSQL's `bin` directory (by default:
         :file:`C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\<version>\\bin`) to your `PATH`.
      #. Create a postgres user with a password using the pg admin gui:

         1. Open **pgAdmin**.
         2. Double-click the server to create a connection.
         3. Select :menuselection:`Object --> Create --> Login/Group Role`.
         4. Enter the username in the **Role Name** field (e.g. `thrivebureau`).
         5. Open the **Definition** tab and enter the password (e.g. `thrivebureau`), then click **Save**.
         6. Open the **Privileges** tab and switch **Can login?** to `Yes` and **Create database?**
            to `Yes`.

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      Thrive Bureau ERP uses PostgreSQL as database management system. Use your package manager to download and
      install PostgreSQL (supported version: 12.0 and later).

      It can be achieved by executing the following:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-client

      By default, the only user is `postgres` but Thrive Bureau ERP forbids connecting as `postgres`, so you need
      to create a new PostgreSQL user:

      .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo -u postgres createuser -s $USER
        $ createdb $USER

      .. note::
         Because your PostgreSQL user has the same name as your Unix login, you will be able to
         connect to the database without password.

   .. group-tab:: Mac OS

      Thrive Bureau ERP uses PostgreSQL as database management system. Use `postgres.app
      <https://postgresapp.com>`_ to download and install PostgreSQL (supported version: 12.0 and
      later).

      .. tip::
         To make the command line tools bundled with `postgres.app` available, make sure to setup your
         `$PATH` variable by following the `Postgres.app CLI Tools Instructions
         <https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html>`_.

      By default, the only user is `postgres` but Thrive Bureau ERP forbids connecting as `postgres`, so you need

      Before installing the dependencies, you must download and install the `Build Tools for Visual
      Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019>`_.
      When prompted, select **C++ build tools** in the **Workloads** tab and install them.

      Thrive Bureau ERP dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file located at the root of the Thrive Bureau ERP
      community directory.

      .. tip::
         It can be preferable to not mix python modules packages between different instances of Thrive Bureau ERP
         or with your system. You can use virtualenv_ to create isolated Python environments.

      Navigate to the path of your Thrive Bureau ERP Community installation (`CommunityPath`) and run **pip** on
      the requirements file in a terminal **with Administrator privileges**:

      .. code-block:: doscon

          C:\> cd \CommunityPath
          C:\> pip install setuptools wheel
          C:\> pip install -r requirements.txt

      For languages with right-to-left interface (such as Arabic or Hebrew), the package `rtlcss`
      is needed:

      #. Download and install `nodejs <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_.
      #. Install `rtlcss`:

         .. code-block:: doscon

             C:\> npm install -g rtlcss

      #. Edit the System Environment's variable `PATH` to add the folder where `rtlcss.cmd` is
         located (typically: :file:`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\`).

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      Using your **distribution packages** is the preferred way of installing dependencies.
      Alternatively, you can install the python dependencies with **pip**.

      .. tabs::

            For Debian-based systems, the packages are listed in the `debian/control
            <{GITHUB_PATH}/debian/control>`_ file of the Thrive Bureau ERP sources.

            On Debian/Ubuntu, the following commands should install the required packages:

            .. code-block:: console

               $ cd /CommunityPath
               $ sed -n -e '/^Depends:/,/^Pre/ s/ python3-\(.*\),/python3-\1/p' debian/control | sudo xargs apt-get install -y

         .. tab:: Install with pip

            As some of the python packages need a compilation step, they require system libraries to
            be installed.

            On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, the following command should install these required
            libraries:

            .. code-block:: console

               $ sudo apt install python3-pip libldap2-dev libpq-dev libsasl2-dev

            Thrive Bureau ERP dependencies are listed in the :file:`requirements.txt` file located at the root of
            the Thrive Bureau ERP community directory.

            .. note::
               | The python packages in :file:`requirements.txt` are based on their stable/LTS
                 Debian/Ubuntu corresponding version at the moment of the Thrive Bureau ERP release.
               | E.g., for Thrive Bureau ERP 15.0, the `python3-babel` package version is 2.8.0 in Debian
                 Bullseye and 2.6.0 in Ubuntu Focal. The lowest version is then chosen in the
                 :file:`requirements.txt`.

            .. tip::
               It can be preferable to not mix python modules packages between different instances

Running Thrive Bureau ERP
------------

Once all dependencies are set up, Thrive Bureau ERP can be launched by running `thrivebureau-bin`, the
command-line interface of the server. It is located at the root of the Thrive Bureau ERP Community directory.

To configure the server, you can either specify :ref:`command-line arguments
<reference/cmdline/server>` or a :ref:`configuration file <reference/cmdline/config>`.

.. tip::
   For the Enterprise edition, you must add the path to the `enterprise` addons to the `addons-path`
   argument. Note that it must come before the other paths in `addons-path` for addons to be loaded
   correctly.

Common necessary configurations are:

- PostgreSQL user and password.
- Custom addon paths beyond the defaults, to load your own modules.

A typical way to run the server would be:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      .. code-block:: doscon

          C:\> cd CommunityPath/
          C:\> python thrivebureau-bin -r dbuser -w dbpassword --addons-path=addons -d mydb

      Where `CommunityPath` is the path of the Thrive Bureau ERP Community installation, `dbuser` is the
      PostgreSQL login, `dbpassword` is the PostgreSQL password, and `mydb` is the name of the
      PostgreSQL database.

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          $ cd /CommunityPath
          $ python3 thrivebureau-bin --addons-path=addons -d mydb

      Where `CommunityPath` is the path of the Thrive Bureau ERP Community installation, and `mydb` is the name
      of the PostgreSQL database.

   .. group-tab:: Mac OS

      .. code-block:: console

          $ cd /CommunityPath
          $ python3 thrivebureau-bin --addons-path=addons -d mydb

      Where `CommunityPath` is the path of the Thrive Bureau ERP Community installation, and `mydb` is the name
      of the PostgreSQL database.

After the server has started (the INFO log `thrivebureau.modules.loading: Modules loaded.` is printed), open
http://localhost:8069 in your web browser and log in with the base administrator account: Use
`admin` for the :guilabel:`Email` and, again, `admin` for the :guilabel:`Password`. That's it, you
just logged into your own Thrive Bureau ERP database!

.. tip::
   - From there, you can create and manage new :doc:`users
     </applications/general/users/manage_users>`.
   - The user account you use to log into Thrive Bureau ERP's web interface differs from the :option:`--db_user
     <thrivebureau-bin -r>` CLI argument.
