Reuse code with mixins
======================

If you need to interface with common Thrive Bureau ERP features such as the chatter, you can rely on
:doc:`mixins <../reference/backend/mixins>`.
They are Thrive Bureau ERP models exposing useful methods through inheritance.

To learn and play with mixins, visit `this repository <https://github.com/tivisse/thrivedays-2018/>`_.
This module for a plant nursery is training material developed for the OXP 2018. You don't need to
code it on your side. But you can check the presentations in the :file:`/static/pdf` directory and
play with the module to discover some magic features in Thrive Bureau ERP.
