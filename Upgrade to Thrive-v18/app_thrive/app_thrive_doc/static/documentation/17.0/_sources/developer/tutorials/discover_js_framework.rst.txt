This tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of the Thrive Bureau ERP Javascript framework. Whether
you are new to the framework or have some prior experience, this tutorial will provide you with a
solid foundation for using the Thrive Bureau ERP JavaScript framework in your projects.

This tutorial is divided into two parts. The first part covers the basics of Owl components, which
are a key part of the Thrive Bureau ERP JS framework. Owl components are reusable UI components that can be used
to build complex web interfaces quickly and efficiently. We will explore how to create and use Owl
components in Thrive Bureau ERP.

The second part of the tutorial focuses on creating a dashboard using various features of Thrive Bureau ERP.
Dashboards are an essential part of any web application, and provide a nice starting point to use
and interact with the Thrive Bureau ERP codebase.

This tutorial assumes that you have some basic knowledge of development with Thrive Bureau ERP in general
(models, controllers, QWeb, ...). If you are new to Thrive Bureau ERP, we recommend that you start with the
:doc:`Getting started </developer/tutorials/getting_started>` tutorial before proceeding with this
one.
